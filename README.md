# klunker
Discord py bot that can play magic the gathering

# Using
A few things you may like/need to know before using this bot.

## Setup
First thing you need to do before using klunker is create a `variable.py` file in the same directory as main.py. In this file you will need to place in your discord bot token gotten from discord.com/developers, into the file, formated as `Token = ""` with the token in the quotes.

## Customizable Parts
Most of the files in `data/` are customizable to your own needs. If you decide to add something to those files or edit the json files, we recommend to keep the same formate as the previous items in the files.
